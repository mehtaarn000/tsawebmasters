        <div class="contentText">
          <p>The solar panel tax credit is a federal incentive that provides tax relief for individuals and businesses that install solar energy systems. This tax credit can be used to reduce the cost of installing and maintaining a solar system, making it more affordable for those looking to go green.

        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Wind Turbines</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Small residential wind turbines can qualify for energy tax credits, which can help offset the cost of installing the turbine at a home. However, in order to qualify, the turbine must produce no more than 100 kilowatt hours of energy for residential use. The home does not have to be your primary residence, and the tax credits will include the installation cost of the turbine. Even better, both existing and new construction homes qualify for the tax credit.
